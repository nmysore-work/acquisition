Description:

AppThwack automatically tested Android, iOS, and web apps on 100s of real, non-emulated phones and tablets, providing reports in minutes so issues are caught well before deployment to customers.

Developers and QA teams upload apps via the web client or through the API (Continuous integration, IDEs, etc) and AppThwack tests them on the desireddevices.

The built-in test suite required no code or instrumentation, and includes install, launch, and stress. In addition to the built-in tests, AppThwack supported custom tests via all popular automation platforms, making it possible to take full control of devices and exercise specific flows and behaviors in a given app.

The company was acquired by Amazon Web Services to help developers test their phone apps in the cloud. After the acquisition, AppThwack shut down.

Acquired on July 14, 2015
