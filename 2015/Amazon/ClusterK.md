Description:

ClusterK offered a software that enabled high availability in the AWS Spot Market, to accelerate and save up to 90% for mission-critical applications. By seamlessly integrating price prediction, multiple markets and offensively rebalancing your application, ClusterK optimizes your infrastructure for performance, availability and the lowest cost.

AWS may have decided to buy the startup to give its customers cheaper cloud options around its spot instances, even as its competitors are cutting prices.

The company closed after Amazon' acquisition.

Acquired on April 29, 2015
