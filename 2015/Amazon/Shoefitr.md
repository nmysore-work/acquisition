Description:

Shoefitr Inc. was a privately held multinational corporation that created software to help internet shoe shoppers find proper fitting footwear. Shoefitr was acquired by Amazon.com in 2015. Amazon uses Shoefitr's 3D scanning technology to acquire measurements of the inside of shoes and compare them. In 2011 Shoefitr was voted most likely to be acquired at LAUNCH Conference. It was also voted the "Startup blastoff winner" at the inaugural SuperConf.
Amazon bought the company in 2015. The decision was prompted by Amazon's goals of boosting sales in the fashion category and trying to provide a better customer experience.

After a query by an Amazon customer in 2016, Amazon customer service revealed that they were no longer using Shoefitr on Amazon but didn't provide any further information regarding the decision.

Acquired on April 10, 2015
