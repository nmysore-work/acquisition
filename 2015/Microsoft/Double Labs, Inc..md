Description:

Double Labs was a startup that developed Echo Notification Lockscreen, a free lockscreen app for Android.

Double Labs' product had over 51,000 user reviews on Google Play Store and a rating of 4.2 out of 5 stars. Its store page claims this app is loved by users in more than 50 countries. It has a minimal design and features automatic grouping, instant notifications, snooze, and various personalization options.

The startup appeared to have been very small. Yin Yin Wu and Xuwen Cao, its cofounders, were the same people behind failed Y Combinator-backed on-demand laundry startup Prim.

The company was closed after Microsoft's acquisition.

Acquired on September 11, 2015
