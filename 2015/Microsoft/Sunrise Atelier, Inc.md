Description:

Sunrise had a suite of calendar products for mobile and desktop users that connects with and consolidates calendars from different providers. It was available on the iPhone, iPad, Android devices, and on the Mac App Store, as well as offering a web client.

On October 28, 2015, Microsoft announced that Sunrise would be discontinued, and its functionality merged into Outlook Mobile. Microsoft later stated that the app would permanently cease functioning on August 31, 2016, but the shutdown was delayed to September 13, 2016 to coincide with an update to Outlook Mobile that incorporates aspects of Sunrise into its calendar interface.
