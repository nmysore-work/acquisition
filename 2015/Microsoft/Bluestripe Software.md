Description:

BlueStripe Software provided the next generation of transaction performance management solutions. BlueStripe's flagship product, FactFinder, is the first management tool to monitor transactions and applications together with the underlying infrastructure, enabling IT Operations to know when transactions get stuck, where they get stuck, and why.

Microsoft planed to fold BlueStripe's software into its System Center and Operations Management Suite software for managing IT resources, giving users more details on how their applications are running on premise and in the cloud.

After the acquisition, the company was closed and the software sales were discontinued.

Acquired on June 10, 2015
