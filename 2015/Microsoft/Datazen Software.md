Description:

Datazen, which launched in 2012, allowed businesses to create mobile dashboards from data in Microsoft Excel, but also from other cloud and enterprise database sources. To run Datazen, enterprises needed to run Windows Server, IIS and .NET behind their firewalls, as well as Datazen's server software.

After Microsoft acquisiiton, it seemed likely that they integrate Datazen's technologies and expertise into its Power BI product.
