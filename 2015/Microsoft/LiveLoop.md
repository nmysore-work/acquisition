Description:

LiveLoop enabled real-time document collaboration within the familiar enterprise desktop environment. LiveLoop's first product is both a PowerPoint plugin and a hosted service that together enable PowerPoint users to work with each other on the same document at the same time. Instead of emailing dozens of attachments back and forth, LiveLoopusers can edit their documents at any time, seeing their colleagues' edits in true keystroke-by-keystroke real time.

Liveloop service shut down just after the acquisition and their team joined Microsoft. 

The acquisition was made to help build great collaboration across Office applications, as part of their strategy and vision to reinvent productivity.

Acquired on March 26, 2015
