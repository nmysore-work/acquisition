Description:

Agawi (formerly iSwifter) was a technology company providing a cloud gaming platform for the gamers. It has developed technology "True Cloud" to stream mobile content over the browser platform without downloading them first, used in applications like in-app adds to preview and promote gaming apps. It allows users to stream all kinds of games (social, casual, mid-core MMO's and core PC games) to TVs, mobile and PC.

Google's move to buy Agawi and integrate its technology as part of the search giant's larger efforts to get people back to using the web, and specifically away from downloading apps in order to enjoy content.

The Agawi team joined Google after the acquisition.
