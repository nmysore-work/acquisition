Description:

Odysee was a library of memories for people who take a LOT of videos (or photos). It lets them archive memories on storage they already have at home, and have all their memories on all their devices, without filling up their phones, and without needing to pay for expensive cloud storage.

After Google's acquisitiom, the Odysee app, was removed from both the Apple App Store and Google Play. The developers joined Google+ team.

Odysee closed in 2015, along with Nimbuzz, the social messaging platform. 

Odysee is now part of LBRY, Inc. and it is a video sharing platform.
