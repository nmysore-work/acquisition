Description:

JVL Ventures, LLC Softcard, was a joint venture between AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon which produced a mobile payments platform known as Softcard, which used near-field communication (NFC) technology to allow users to pay for items at stores and restaurants with credit and debit card credentials stored on their smartphones.

The Softcard service was discontinued on March 31, 2015, and the three founding carriers pledged support for Google Wallet. In May 2015, Google unveiled Android Pay as a successor to Google Wallet and Softcard.
