Description:

Endaga launched out of University of California at Berkeley's Technology and Infrastructure for Emerging Regions research group. The group built a mobile telecommunications network that could run out of a small box attached to a tree in a remote village.

After Meta's acquisition, the company closed and Endagas' founders and CEO joined Facebook.

"Over the past year, our team has worked hard to empower communities in this way, and we believe Facebook's mission to connect the world aligns perfectly with this vision.", wrote the team.

Acquired on October 3, 2015
