Description:

QuickFire Networks was a TC Disrupt 2014 Battlefield contestant that built a custom hardware and software platform for reducing video file sizes and upload times. 

QuickFire's tech speeded up encoding videos with different profiles for frame rate, resolution, color and audio settings for different platforms. QuickFire's solution relied on custom motherboards built to accommodate 11 high-end Intel Core i7 processors.

After their acquisition, the business closed and their team joined Facebook.
