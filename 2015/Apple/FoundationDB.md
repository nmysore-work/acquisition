Description:

FoundationDB, headquartered in Vienna, VA, was started in 2009 by Nick Lavezzo, Dave Rosenthal, and Dave Scherer, drawing on their experience in executive and technology roles at their previous company, Visual Sciences.

FoundationDB is a free and open-source multi-model distributed NoSQL database with a shared-nothing architecture. The product was designed around a "core" database, with additional features supplied in "layers." The core database exposes an ordered key-value store with transactions.The transactions are able to read or write multiple keys stored on any machine in the cluster while fully supporting ACID properties. 

In March 2015, the company was acquired by Apple Inc.

On April 19, 2018, Apple open sourced the software, releasing it under the Apache 2.0 license.

Acquired on March 24, 2015
