Description:

Mapsense was formed in 2013 by Erez Cohen, a former engineer for the data science company Palantir Technologies. The company's offering lets users slice and dice graphical models of maps that hold huge sums of data. It's cloud-based, naturally. The company launched its developer platform in May, noting that it was welcoming customers from the financial sector, advertising, government and Fortune 500 firms.

Apple bought the company in 2015, it was unclear what Apple's plans were for Mapsense, but it seemed to be a sign that Apple was pushing heavier into the location and mapping services space.

Acquired on September 2015
