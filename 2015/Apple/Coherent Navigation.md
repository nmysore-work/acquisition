Description:

Coherent Navigation Inc provided space based navigation services. The Company offers satellite navigation hardware, software which includes precise, secure, robust positioning, timing, and communication solutions.

After Apple's acquisition, the company closed and many employers started working in Apple.

It was unclear exactly what the Coherent Navigation team was working on at Apple and whether there was a specific technology Apple was interested in or if it simply wanted to apply the expertise of Coherent's employees to its own projects. 

Acquired on April 2015
