Vision and Mission 

We are committed to creating a culture that inspires great work because original and remarkable work makes more people smile and generates more opportunity. We thrive on being a hub of creative collaboration by colliding visual artists with programmers, engineers with designers, storytellers with illustrators, architects with machinists.  Our approach to work is more charming than hip, more hand-crafted than slick, more clever than complicated. We love cool tools and gear but we especially love what they allow us to realize and how that creativity can inspire the culture we contribute to and depend on.
