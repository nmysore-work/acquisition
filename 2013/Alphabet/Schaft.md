Description:

Schaft got its start at Tokyo University's Jouhou System Kougaku (JSK) Laboratory before becoming a private company in 2013. Before spinning off into Schaft, the JSK Lab developed and patented a new motor that provided humanoid robots with better strength and balance, IEEE Spectrum reported at the time.

Google acquired Schaft just a few months before the DARPA challenge,  a contest to see which team can create the best disaster-response robot on the planet, which Schaft dominated.

After failing to find a buyer, Alphabet shut down the company focused on bipedal robots.

Acquired on December 2, 2013
