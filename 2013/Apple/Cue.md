Description:

Cue (formerly Greplin) was a website and app that pulled information from online accounts to present an overview of a user's day. Cue operated by linking various user accounts belonging to a registered individual and running a query search for keywords within those applications or accounts. For example, someone may have wanted to use a single search feature to check their Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter accounts without signing in and checking each one individually.

In 2013, Apple Inc. bought the company, with the price estimated between $35 to $45 million. Cue premium users were refunded.

Acquired on October 3, 2013
