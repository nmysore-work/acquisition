DEscription:

Parse, Inc. produced back-end tools for mobile developers that help mobile developers store data in the cloud, manage identity log-ins, handle push notifications and run custom code in the cloud.

Facebook shut it down in January of 2017.

After the hosted service was shut down, the open source version grew into an open source community with its own blog, documentation, and community forum.
