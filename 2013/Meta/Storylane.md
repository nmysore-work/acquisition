Description:

Founded in 2011, Storylane was designed to be a foil to social networks that prompted users to share moments of their life in quick snapshots or in text posts of 140 characters of less. The site pushed users to answer larger questions about their lives, such as religion or childhood.

Meta acquired the company, but not the stories.

(not much information about it)

Acquired on March 2013
