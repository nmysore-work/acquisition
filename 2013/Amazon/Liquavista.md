Description:

Liquavista was a Dutch-based company founded in 2006 as a spin-off from Philips. Its research and development have included efforts to develop colour e-paper video screens that can work with or without a backlight using electrowetting technology. Liqavista began the final step in fully commercialising the technology in 2010, as it sent out SDKs to OEMs. 

In 2018, Amazon shut down Liquavista but did not indicate what happened to the technology. Later in September 2020, LookGadgets acquired the domain liquavista.com.

Acquired on May 13, 2013
