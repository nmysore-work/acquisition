Description:

InRelease is a product created by InCycle for automatically deploying application components to target services in different environments.

InRelease enables agile .NET teams to automate the release cycles of their apps. It automates deployments directly from Microsoft's Team Foundation Server, Microsoft's own ALM and DevOps solution, to allenvironments, including production. This ensures all deployments are done the same way. It also automates the approval workflow and auditing support.

The acquisition of the continuous deployment solution, InRelease, will add Release Management capabilities to Microsoft's ALM and DevOps solutions, helping customers deliver applications faster, better and more efficiently.
