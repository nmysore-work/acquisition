Description:

CrowdTangle was created to give greater insight into what's happening on social media. Initially it was built to help organize social causes on Facebook. While the first version as a whole didn't take off, one feature did: the ability to show what social content overperformed on Facebook Pages.

CrowdTangle expanded to include other social platforms and became an important way for newsrooms and media organizations to monitor performance and identify emerging stories. 

Facebook acquired CrowdTangle in 2016, made the tool free, and expanded access from 300 media partners to more than 10,000, including global sports leagues, local newspapers, digital publishers, music labels, celebrity accounts, and more.

Acquired on November 11, 2016
