Description:

Groove was a provider of an application for personalized music. The company provided a mobile application for browsing and downloading new music and and creating personalized playlist.

Back in 2015, Microsoft rebranded its Xbox Music streaming service as Groove, but they had one problem with the name, it was shared by another music service, developed by Canadian startup Zikera.

For that reason, Microsoft acquired Groove in 2016. As part of the acquisition, the app was shut down and no longer available to downland.

Acquired on February 9, 2016
