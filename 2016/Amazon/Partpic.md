Description:

Partpic was a visual recognition technology company that allows users to save time and money searching for replacement maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) parts. By allowing users to snap a picture of a part with a smart device, Partpic matched the user generated image with a part and associated specifications.

After acquiring Partpic in 2016, Amazon was seen releasing a similar service by the name of Part Finder. Partpic was the technology behind this service.

Acquired on November 2, 2016
