Description:

Curse is a network of gaming websites. The company is headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama, and has offices in San Francisco, New York City, Los Angeles, Brighton, and Berlin.

Curse initially focused on offering mods for various video games. As it expanded, the company began to develop and acquire gaming communities (particularly focusing on MMORPG titles such as World of Warcraft, as well as other games such as Minecraft), wikis, as well as offering voice chat services. The company also sponsored an eponymous eSports club, which competed primarily in League of Legends.

On August 16, 2016, Curse announced that it had agreed to be acquired by Amazon.com via its subsidiary Twitch Interactive for an undisclosed amount. On December 12, 2018, Fandom announced that they had acquired Curse's media assets, including its gaming community websites, Gamepedia wiki farm and D&DBeyond. The remainder of the company (operating as CurseForge) remained under Twitch. In the middle of 2020, CurseForge was sold from Twitch to Overwolf.
