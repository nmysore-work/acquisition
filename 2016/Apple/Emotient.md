Description:

Emotient was the leading authority on automated facial expression recognition and analysis, designed to enable emotionally aware technologies that are redefining the future of personal computing.

Emotient's software read the expressions of individuals and crowds to gain insights that can be used by advertisers to assess viewer reaction or a medical practitioner to better understand signs of pain in patients.

In 2016, Apple bought the company, the Emotient team joined them and the company was shut down.
