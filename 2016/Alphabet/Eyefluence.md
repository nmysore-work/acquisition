Description:

Eyefluence was a small eye tracking or eye tracking company created in 2013 with a single goal, to allow users to interact with virtual reality through sight. Eyefluence could perform actions with the movement of our eye since it takes advantage of eye movement to use it as a mouse.

In 2016 it was acquired by Google with the aim of joining any kind of forces to continue advancing the interaction of our eye with technology.

Eyefluence, now part of Google, is a company that has in its hands the technology that both virtual reality and augmented reality need most right now, which is eye tracking.
