Description:

ProtoGeo Oy provides mobile phone software. The Company offers an application that records and calculates the walking, transportation, cycling, and running activities of a client.

The app required no external hardware, but instead used sensors already built into smartphones. Moves did most of its data processing remotely, on ProtoGeo's servers. Moves was supposed to continue to operate independently, adding another stand-alone app to Facebook's growing stable.

Moves officially closed the app on July 31, 2018.
