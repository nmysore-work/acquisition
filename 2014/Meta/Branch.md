Description:

Branch (formerly Roundtable), enabled a smart new brand of high quality public discourse. Curated groups of people were invited to engage around issues in which they are knowledgeable. This service holds the promise of a new platform for dialogue on the web - a necessary departure from the monologues we have grown so accustomed to reading online.

Facebook bring the Branch team aboard to help improve the quality of conversation people have within the site.
