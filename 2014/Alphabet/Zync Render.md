Description:

ZYNC is the visual effects industry's first completely integrated cloud-based storage and rendering solution. This pay as you go service provides encrypted, instant and affordable access to high volume computing resources. It supported platforms include Maya/VRay/Mental Ray/Arnold and Nuke.

In 2020, Google announced that the company was getting shut down.

The service remained available to existing users until 1 June 2021, but has now been closed entirely with the old Zync Render website now redirecting to a generic Google Cloud product pag
