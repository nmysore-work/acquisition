Description:

Vidmaker was co-founded in 2011 by Emmons, Ryan Bolyard, and Yuri Zapuchlak.

Vidmaker was a collaborative online video editor that makes it easy to work with video anywhere and with anyone. Users can work together in real time with video, images and sound from services like Dropbox and Google Drive, and effortlessly share their projects either on Vidmaker's video platform or YouTube.

After Youtube bought it, the service was shut down while making the transition to their new home.
