Description:

Appetas' technology can instantly create beautiful web, mobile, and social sites for restaurants using their real menu, hours, and location. We reach restaurants through established partner channels and provide our marketingplatform as a service.
Individual and small chain restaurants struggle to establish a quality online presence. They understand the importance of marketing online but existing options are too complex, expensive, and time consuming.

After their acquisition, co founders shut down the company to join Google, they wrote 
"We're very excited to use what we've learned with Appetas to create something even better at Google."

Acquired on May 7, 2014
