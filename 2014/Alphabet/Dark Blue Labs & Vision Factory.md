Description:

Dark Blue Labs specialised in deep learning for understanding natural language, something Googleâ€™s search products have been pioneering on a large scale with both typed and spoken natural language queries. Google's voice search is built into every Android smartphone and tablet, while desktop users can also search using voice through a web browser.

Vision Factory specialised in visual recognition systems and deep learning, applying artificial intelligence techniques to enhance the accuracy and speed of object recognition and other vision-based computer systems.

Dark Blue Labs and Vision Factory and their seven key researchers were added to Google's DeepMind artificial intelligence research company, another British artificial intelligence startup which the search giant acquired in January 2014.

Acquired on October 23, 2014
