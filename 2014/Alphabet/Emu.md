Description:

Emu is texting with a built-in assistant. Schedule lunches, share your location, and set reminders - as easily as sending a photo. It's texting, for grown-ups.

Created by veterans of Siri, Apple, Google, TechCrunch, and Yahoo! Messenger, Emu is a messaging product for iPhone that uses artificial intelligence - machine learning and naturallanguage processing - to understand messages, then magically adds relevant information to help you schedule a lunch, reserve a table, buy movie tickets, or share your location in real time.

The app was removed from the App Store and their team join Google.
