Description:

SlickLogin was an Israeli start-up company that developed sound-based password alternatives. The company's goal was to enable end users to log in easily to password-protected websites by using a uniquely generated sound.

The company was founded by Or Zelig, who served as the firm's CEO, Eran Galili, CTO, and Ori Kabeli, VP of R&D. They were recent graduates of the IDF's elite cyber-security unit and spent over six years working on information security projects.

The company was closed after the acquisition.

Acquired on February 16, 2014
