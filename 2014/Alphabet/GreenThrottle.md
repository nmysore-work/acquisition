Description:

Green Throttle Games is a video game and video game peripheral developer.

The company was founded by RedOctane founder Charles Huang, Palm, Inc.'s Matt Crowley, and Karl Townsend, the original Palm Pilot's lead engineer. They started the company with $6 million in venture capital with the intention to "develop internal games, support external development, and advance software services". Their first project is software that lets players connect the company's controller to their Android device, which can connect to a television. VentureBeat's Dean Takahashi called their late entry to the market a weakness.

The team joined Google after their acquisition.
