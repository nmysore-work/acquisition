Description:

Parature provided on-demand customer service software, making it possible for any business to leverage the Internet to provide outstanding customer service and online support. Parature provides an efficient way to serve, support, retain, engage with and maximize the value of every customer. Parature's software-as-a-service (SaaS) delivery andintegrated, intuitive design enable organizations to run efficiently.

After the acquisition, Microsoft's plan was to continue to offer Parature as a standalone service, as well as a product integrated with Dynamics CRM on-premises and CRM Online.

By the end of 2017, Microsoft told partners that Parature would no longer be available for new sales.

On May 31, 2018, Microsoft quietly posted a public note to its partners that it was "ready to initiate the migration process of our Parature customers to Dynamics 365 for Customer Service."

Acquired on January 7, 2014
