Description:

Aorato's sophisticated technology uses machine learning to detect suspicious activity on a company’s network. It understands what normal behavior is and then identifies anomalies, so a company can quickly see suspicious behavior and take appropriate measures to help protect itself. Key to Aorato’s approach is the Organizational Security Graph, a living, continuously-updated view of all of the people and machines accessing an organization's Windows Server Active Directory (AD). AD is used by most enterprises to store user identities and administer access to critical business applications and systems.

After the acquisition, the company closed and their team joined Microsoft.

Acquired on November 13, 2014
