Description:

Mojang Studios is a Swedish video game developer and Xbox Game Studios studio based in Stockholm . The studio was founded by Markus Persson (commonly known as Notch) in 2009 as Mojang Specifications , inheriting the name from a company of the same name that he left two years earlier. 

Mojang began developing the sandbox video game Minecraft in 2009, which would go on to become the best-selling video game of all time.and would establish a successful multimedia franchise. Mojang Specifications became Mojang AB in late 2010. Wanting to abandon Minecraft , Persson sold Mojang to Microsoft Studios in 2014. In May 2020, Mojang changed its name to Mojang Studios.

Mission:

"We will say this: play is at the heart of Mojang Studios. It's the blocky backbone of our games, the core of our development philosophy, and even entangled in our name (which roughly translates to "gadget" in lovely, old-timey Swedish)."
