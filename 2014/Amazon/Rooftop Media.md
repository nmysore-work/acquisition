Description:

Rooftop Media was an audio and video comedy company founded in 2006. It provided a platform for standup comedians to showcase their talent online and gain a new source of income by attracting an online audience. It did that by recording comedians at clubs across the country and playing the videos on their platform through live broadcast or on-demand service.

The company focused on live performances and aimed to transform the production of media programming. Rooftop's media partners included Apple Inc, Yahoo, and streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora.

After the acquisition, Rooftop's content became a part of the fast-growing Audible platform. This worked in favor of the company and connected it to a larger audience, according to the CEO of Rooftop.

Acquired on August 25, 2014
