Description:

Iconology Inc., ComiXology (styled comiXology), is a cloud-based digital distribution platform for comics owned by Amazon, with over 200 million comic downloads as of September 2013. It offers a selection of more than 100,000 comic books, graphic novels, and manga across Android, iOS, Kindle Fire, Windows 10, and the Internet.

During 2021 Amazon.com was to close the ComiXology website in a move to integrate ComiXology into Amazon Kindle, but was delayed to 2022, due to community feedback. During February 2022, the ComiXology website updated their FAQ on their website with new information to indicate the coming changes which were brought about on February 17, 2022, to which ComiXology is only available on Amazon.com or through their update to the ComiXology app that was done two days earlier on February 15, 2022.
