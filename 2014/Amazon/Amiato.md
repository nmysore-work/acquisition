Description:

Amiato was a startup founded in 2011 that provided real-time integration services to extract unstructured data from flexible databases such as NoSQL and MongoDB. With this, Amiato created a structure that could then be analyzed with its technology and business intelligence tools. This included interactive ad-hoc analysis, reports, and capabilities to combine silos. 

Amiato was bought by Amazon and it seemed like the move was made both as a technology and talent acquisition. 

The company closed and their developers joined Amazon.

Acquired on May 2014
