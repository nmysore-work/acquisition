Description:

Prss launched in 2013, and was the result of the work of the founding team's creation of Trvl, one of the first iPad newsstand magazines. It was the first iPad-exclusive newsstand publication when it debuted in 2010, and featured a photo-rich design. 

Prss was designed to leverage the expertise Trvl co-founders Jochem Wijnands and Michel Elings into an open platform any iPad magazine publisher could use.
