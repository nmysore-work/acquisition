Description:

Booklamp.org was a system for matching readers to books through an analysis of writing styles. The technology BookLamp allowed you to find books that were written with a similar tone, tense, perspective, action level, description level and dialogue level.

BookLamp was called the "Pandora of books" because of its "Book Genome Project," which refered to a big data approach to analyzing readers' tastes and suggesting new titles. This technology was presumably, added to Apple's iBooks business.

The company closed after Apple acquisition.

Acquired on June 29, 2014
