Description:

Dryft was a virtual keyboard that let you type naturally on touch screens. You just rest your fingers on the screen and begin typing as you would on a normal keyboard - and just as fast!

Dryft allowed you to type without looking, preserving the muscle memory you've built up over years of typing. 

From the founders of Swype, Dryft was the answer to efficient content creation on your tablet. (Dryft was a spin-out of Cleankeys Inc, a company that manufactures cleanable glass-surfaced keyboards for healthcare environments.)

Dryfts tecnology was used for IOs keyboard.
