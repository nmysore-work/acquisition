Description:

The startup was founded and run solely by John Papandriopoulos, an electrical engineering PhD from the University Of Melbourne who invented a way to make the iPhone's camera take full-resolution photos at 20 to 30 frames per second, significantly faster than Apple's native iPhone camera.

After the acquisition, the app was removed from the App Store and the company closed so the team could join Apple's team.
