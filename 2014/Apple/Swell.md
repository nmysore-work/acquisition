Description:

Swell was the headless e-commerce platform that enables developers, agencies, and merchants around the world the tools and infrastructure needed to sell the way they want.

Swell's strength was in its podcast discovery feature. At first launch users would select from a dozen or so pre-defined categories and Swell would use an algorithm to select individual podcasts for you. Like Pandora and iTunes Radio, Swell learned from skips, likes, shares and listen times to serve more relevant podcasts.
